## 🎉 First Project for Oracle Next Education (ONE) with Alura 🎓

Welcome to the repository for my first project developed as part of the Oracle Next Education (ONE) program, in partnership with Alura! 🚀

### 🧐 What Does This Project Do?
This project is a simple Guessing Game application. It combines three core web technologies:

**HTML** for structuring the visual content.
**CSS** for styling and creating an attractive interface.
**JavaScript** for adding interactive logic, such as calculating a random number and handling user interaction through prompts and alerts.

*Though simple, this project explores the integration of these three technologies and demonstrates how they work together to create dynamic web experiences.*

### 🌟 Key Features
1. Responsive HTML & CSS
Uses good practices such as CSS variables, Flexbox for alignment, and gradients for a visually appealing design.

2. Functional JavaScript
Modular code using functions to make the logic readable and easy to maintain.

Dynamic user interaction handled via native prompts and alerts.
